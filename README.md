## Overview

A personal profile card with clickable social links, built as part of a coding challenge.  
The goal: Practice responsive design, utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS, and semantic HTML structure.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started with using sematic tags, set up tailwindcss using node and used flexbox for the layout 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Using custom tailwind styles and modifying default custom styles and how to style custom focus states for links

### Continued development

Next I would like to focus on adding a dark and light mode that users can toggle, add an animated hover effect using javascript 


### Useful resources
